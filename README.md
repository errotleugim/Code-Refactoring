This is a refactoring of the Horiseon's homepage. 
The objective in this repository is to update the basic HTML code to semantic HTML for the purpose of code clarity and accessibility.
<div> tags were replaced with semantic tags.
Redundant classes were removed from the CSS file.
The title of the page was modified.
Comments were added to help readability of the code.
